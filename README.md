# Basic Web Server

This is a basic web server project which is part of the Full Stack Development course at The Odin Project.

This project is a simple web server which responds to GET requests. The server listens on port 8080 and returns the appropriate HTML file based on the URL requested.

The server was built using Node.js and the HTTP module. The file system module was used to read the HTML files.

The server currently responds to the following URLs:

- /
- /about
- /contact-me

If any other URL is requested, the server will return a 404 error page.

This project was built to demonstrate an understanding of the HTTP protocol and how web servers work.
